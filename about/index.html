        <span class="brand">Fleet Fix Rescue</span> believes every mile matters.
        Trucks are more than machines. They are the backbone of America’s economy.
        From long-haul semi trucks crossing state lines to dump trucks and
        heavy-duty vehicles supporting local work, we understand how important
        it is to keep trucks moving.
      </p>

      <p>
        That belief shapes our mission:
        <strong>
          to provide reliable, high-quality, and dependable truck rescue services
        </strong>
        across the nation.

    </div>

    <h3 class="about-title">Our Journey</h3>
    <div class="underline"></div>

    <p>
      Fleet Fix Rescue was built on a simple belief. Truck drivers deserve more
      than just a tow truck. They need dependable support when it matters most.
      Being stranded on the roadside, far from home, with pressure building and
      schedules slipping is something we understand well.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is why we created Fleet Fix Rescue. To be the team that responds at any
      hour, with skilled technicians, the right tools, and a genuine commitment
      to helping drivers move forward.
